# Results
Currently I've only used simd option as it seems to be most suitable, plan to experiment with other variants more. Data was generated randomly. Current results show that simd option doesn't seem to provide a significant increase in performance(avg. in 10 measurements with 1024 * 1024 matrix - 1.079 seconds for omp and 1.092 seconds for sequential). GSL solver with Householder transofrmations performs worse on given data(probably because of the expensive algorithm).
